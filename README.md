# Hackathon Logistics in Java

## Inspiration

With my experiences with hosting hackathon, there tend to be a challenge with the redemption process where we have to ensure that every participant is redeeming the right number of their SWAG and will often have to perform checks which will lead to longer wait time and unfavourable participant experience in hackathon.

Hence, this REST API is a practice to solve the problem and potentially be used in the future hackathon to help out in the logistical issue of redemption of the participant SWAG.

## Features
- Register a new participant
- Update a participant's information
- Update a participant's tshirt sizing
- Create a new record for participant claiming SWAG for himself/herself (either id, name, email)
- Create records for participant claiming SWAG for his/her entire team (either id, name, email, team name)
